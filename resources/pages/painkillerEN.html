  <p>Against the background of how many food companies are implementing various environmental initiatives in an attempt to reduce
         negative impact on the environment, the British bakery chain Gail’s decided to supplement its product range
         bakery products made from food waste.</p>

      Such a step will allow the disposal of unsold products, as in the future the bakery intends to become waste-free
      business. One of the novelties of the bakery is English cross buns with bacon - the sourdough for them is prepared from
      dried residues of unsold bread, and when combined with the dough, processed bread makes up a third of all
      components of the finished bun. The bakery also turns baguettes into crackers and creates crackers from leftover cheese.
      Gail’s management announced that at least 25 new products will appear in the bakery within a year, production
      which will help reduce the amount of food waste.

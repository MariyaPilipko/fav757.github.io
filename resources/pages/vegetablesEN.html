    <h3>How heat treatment of vegetables affects the content of vitamins</h3>

  <p>Recently, one of my readers asked how baked bell peppers are rich in vitamin C or
         it is completely resolved by heat treatment. This question prompted me to prepare a more detailed answer to
         the question of preserving vitamins and other nutrients during the heat treatment of vegetables in the form of this article.</p>

      Indeed, various cooking methods alter the nutrient composition of fruits and vegetables, but this is not
      always bad. Some studies show that, although heat treatment of products may lead to
      the degradation of some nutrients, while the availability of others may increase.

      Therefore, to say that there is a "best" form of plant consumption, for example, raw, is impossible.

      Many people believe that raw vegetables contain more nutrients than cooked vegetables, but, again, this
      Depends on the type of nutrients. In one study conducted in Germany with 200 people who
      adhering to a diet based on raw foods, it was found that beta-carotene levels in their body were
      elevated, but plasma lycopene levels are significantly lower than average. Probably due to the fact that fresh, raw
      tomatoes are indeed characterized by a lower lycopene content than cooked or processed
      Tomatoes Heat treatment destroys the thick cell walls of many plants, freeing up nutrient
      substances stored in them.

      Water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and B vitamins, as well as a group of nutrients called
      polyphenols are most vulnerable to processing and cooking. Canned peas and carrots lose from 85
      up to 95 percent of its natural vitamin C. Another study found that frozen cherries lose
      up to 50 percent of anthocyanins - nutrients found in the dark pigment of fruits and vegetables. In the process
      Cooking from fresh spinach removes about two-thirds of vitamin C.

      Depending on the cooking method used, the loss of vitamin C in home cooking can vary from
      15 to 55 percent, according to a survey of researchers from the University of California at Davis. Interesting that levels
      Vitamin C is often higher in frozen foods compared to fresh foods - this is likely to happen.
      because vitamin C dies during storage and transportation of fresh food.

      Fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K, and antioxidant compounds called carotenoids,
      become more accessible after preparation and processing. In an article in The Journal of Agriculture and Food
      Chemistry ”concludes that carrots, zucchini and broccoli are better to cook than steam, fry or
      serve raw. Least of all nutrients is stored during frying.

      But when it comes to cooking vegetables, you always need to look for compromises. You can increase the availability of one
      nutrient, while destroying another. For example, boiled carrots have significantly more carotenoids, according to
      compared to raw carrots. However, raw carrots contain much more polyphenols, which disappear as soon as
      you start to cook it.

      Summarizing all this, it is fashionable to say that no cooking method is ideal in terms of maintaining 100%
      nutrients in vegetables. And since the best vegetables are the ones you really will eat, the taste also
      should be considered when deciding on the method of preparation.

      The best way to get the most out of your vegetables is to enjoy them in many ways - in raw
      steamed, boiled, baked and fried. If you regularly eat a variety of fruits and
      vegetables, you do not need to worry about how to cook them.

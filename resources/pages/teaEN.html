      Tea Making Rules
      Use soft, sweet water, free of minerals and odorless. Bring it to a boil, but do not boil it.
      There are two ways to make tea. The first way: brewing.
      1. Select a teapot that matches the number of participants in the tea party.
      2. Control the brewing time, pour each brewing on time (after all, good tea can be brewed several
      time).
      3. Do not allow the teapot to cool. Water the kettle with hot water if necessary.
      4. Track when tea reaches its peak. If you feel that the next brew will be weaker than the previous,
      stop brewing (otherwise you really want to eat).
      Method Two: Cooking
      1. Choose the right amount of tea. In a 1.5-liter kettle put 12-15 grams of puer, 7-10 grams of red
      tea, 5-7 grams of green, yellow or white tea.
      2. Soak the tea in cold water until the water in the kettle begins to boil.
      3. To saturate the water in the kettle with oxygen, drain a little water into the creamer when the first bubbles begin
      separate from the bottom, and when the water begins to boil, fill the water back.
      4. Do not brew tea! It is enough that the water with tea just boils. If the tea leaf is in water at a temperature
      100 degrees, guanine alkaloid, harmful to the liver and heart, is released from it.

      The benefits of tea
      Most of the beneficial properties of green tea are due to the fact that the leaves of this plant contain a lot of water-soluble
      polyphenols - catechins. Their benefits extend to almost all human organ systems. They protect
      cardiovascular and nervous systems, liver, obstruct the development of obesity, diabetes, malignant
      tumors. And in combination with other anti-cancer substances, catechins give a synergistic effect. For instance,
      curcumin (found in turmeric) and catechins of green tea reinforce each other's action in the cancer cells of the thick
      intestines and larynx. The combination of catechins and vanilla capsicum leads to their synergy in prevention
      different types of cancer. One study found that catechins and vanilloids in a 25: 1 ratio
      destroy cancer cells 100 times more efficiently than green tea alone.

      Warnings
      1. Do not drink tea right before meals, it dilutes the saliva, which makes the food seem tasteless, in addition,
      may decrease protein uptake. It is better to drink this drink at least 20-30 minutes before a meal.
      2. After a meal, pause for half an hour: the tannin in tea can impair the absorption of protein and iron.
      3. Avoid too hot or cold tea. Hot tea can damage the throat, esophagus and stomach. Frequent
      drinking tea above 62 degrees leads to increased vulnerability of the walls of the stomach. Iced tea can
      cause the accumulation of sputum, interfere with digestion, contribute to the appearance of weakness and colds.
      The optimum tea temperature is 56 degrees.
      4. Do not drink cooled tea. If the tea leaves in the kettle cool down or the tea is brewed for too long, tea phenol and
      essential oils begin to spontaneously oxidize, this greatly reduces the benefits of tea. But the tea that stood
      day, it is quite possible to use for medicinal purposes, but as an external remedy. It is rich in acids and fluoride, which
      prevent bleeding from capillaries, so yesterday's tea helps with inflammation of the oral cavity and
      bleeding gums, eczema, superficial skin lesions, ulcers. Rinse your mouth in the morning before
      brush your teeth, and after eating not only leaves you feeling fresh, but also strengthens your teeth.
      5. Do not drink tea at night, due to the exciting effect of thein and aromatic substances. Although some puers,
      on the contrary, they can improve sleep.
      6. Pregnant women should not drink a lot of tea: thein negatively affects the development of the fetus. In five cups of strong tea
      drunk per day, contains the amount of thein that can lead to underweight in an infant.
      In addition, thein speeds up the heartbeat and increases urination, which increases the load on the heart and kidneys and
      increases the likelihood of toxicosis.
      7. Suffering from a stomach ulcer, duodenal ulcer and high acidity should drink tea in moderate
      quantities (better puer or weak tea with milk). A healthy stomach contains a phosphoric acid compound,
      which reduces the secretion of stomach acid. But theophylline contained in tea can suppress the function of this
      compounds, resulting in increased acidity in the stomach, and ulcers will heal more slowly.
      8. Patients with atherosclerosis and severe hypertension should not drink strong tea: theophylline and thein excite
      central nervous system, which causes the vessels of the brain to narrow.
      It is important to understand that tea, like any medicinal herb, is an individual thing and has an individual effect. therefore
      when choosing tea for yourself, you must first focus on your body, your state of health. There are people,
      which tea is suitable, there are those who are not suitable.
      Although the main effect of tea, thanks to which it became the most popular drink in the world, is not medicinal, but
      tonic, increasing the speed of thinking during body relaxation. Therefore, it is usually drunk in the company, for more
      liberated promise.

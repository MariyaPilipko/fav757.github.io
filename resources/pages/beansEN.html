  <p>Legumes - beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils - the cornerstone of any healthy diet. They have unique
         properties, such as anti-cancer (for more information on the benefits of beans, I talk here).
    
         In this article I want to share the curious facts that McGreevey, the head of American
         Bean Association (the American Pulse Association).</p>

      Rhey are cheap

            Beans, peas and lentils are one of the most affordable sources of protein: more than 20 grams per 100 grams of product.
            The same amount is in chicken, a little more in beef. Now look how much these products cost in the near
            supermarket or market, and compare the price of one gram of protein from legumes and meat.
      
            Centenarians eat beans every day
      
            Legumes predominate in the diets of residents of the "blue zones" - territories around the globe with a high concentration
            centenarians. Read more about the diet of those who live to be a hundred years old, please follow this link.
      
            Digestion problems can be avoided
      
            Beans contain complex carbohydrates, and by fermenting them, our stomach bacteria can produce gas. To avoid
            gas generation is simple:
      
            - introduce legumes into your diet gradually (the problem with gas formation usually disappears after about a week);
      
            - soak the beans for several hours or at night and drain the water before starting cooking;
      
            - combine legumes with spices such as turmeric, ginger or fennel.

      The darker the better

      As with vegetables, the richer the color of the legumes, the higher the concentration of antioxidants that protect cells from
      oxidation. One study found that black bean pods contain 40 times more antioxidants than
      white bean pods.

      Double load

      Legumes are the only product that can be classified as vegetables and proteins (in accordance with
      USDA).

      Famous status

      Even the ancient Romans came up with names based on the names of legumes: Lentulus (lentils - lentils), Fabius (fava -
      green beans), Piso (peas - peas), Cicero (chickpeas - chickpeas). According to Roman leaders, these products
      embody the characteristic features of the entire population and, taking these names, they will prove that they show public interest.

      How old are they?

      Researchers from Israel discovered green beans in an archaeological site 10 thousand years old.
      People of the Neolithic era were among the first farmers in the world. Their diet contained important cereals, but protein and fiber
      they received almost exclusively from green beans, lentils, peas and chickpeas.

      Legumes may have been the basis of food in the past, and they are returning to become the food of the future. After all, they are not only
      nutritious and useful, but contribute to sustainable agriculture, saturating the soil with nitrogen. Add to that that bean
      are a sustainable culture - and we get reason to believe that they will become an extremely important product for
      food security in our growing world.

      Preparation
      We prepare meatballs:

      Mix ground beef and pork by hand. Add onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, egg and mix well.
      Add milk and spices.

      From the resulting mass make small balls. Put them on a clean plate, cover and leave in the refrigerator for 2
      hours (this will help the meatballs keep their shape during cooking).

      Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. As soon as the pan heats up, lay out the meatballs,
      fry them on all sides (until brown).

      Then place the meatballs on a baking sheet and cover. Place the meatballs in a preheated oven (up to 180 ° C in normal
      mode and up to 160 ° C - in convection) for 30 minutes.

      Prepare cream sauce:

      Melt 40 g of butter in a frying pan. Then add 40 g of wheat flour to the oil and stir
      for 2 minutes. Add 150 ml of vegetable broth and 150 ml of beef broth and continue to stir.
      Add 150 ml of cream, 2 tsp. soy sauce 1 tsp. Dijon mustard. Bring the mass to a boil and
      wait until the sauce thickens.

      Serve meatballs with potatoes. Enjoy!

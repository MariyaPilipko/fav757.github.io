  <p>"Natural wine is something that is not made of powder?" - constantly hears in comments to posts and at tastings is guilty
         expert Irina Gridina. Especially for vogue.ua, she told everything you need to know about this increasingly popular
         drink.</p>

      In fact, everything is completely different. Powdered wines are a myth, but very tenacious, and we will definitely not stand on it
      to concentrate, and here about natural wines we will talk in more detail. What is it, how are they formed, what
      are different from ordinary wines and, finally, how useful are they - and are they useful?

      To begin with, a little background. In 1798, the priest Thomas Malthus (Thomas Malthus) calculated that the population
      the globe will grow exponentially, while the amount of resources needed - for example, food, only in
      arithmetic. This theory was called the "Malthusian abyss" and became a source of concern for many
      inquisitive. Thanks to "more efficient" agriculture, transition to monocultures, "green revolution"
      and the widespread use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, we have, on the one hand, harmed the planet, but on the other
      hand, saved millions (if not billions) of lives.

      Everything is not as clear as it may seem at first, and you do not need to look for the devil where he is not (for example, in
      traditional wine producers who use chemicals in the vineyard and oenological preparations for wineries). But, with
      on the other hand, we can and should know about "other" wines, and it is only our choice - what we drink.

      Grapes are more difficult to grow than wheat, and, unfortunately, the amount of chemicals used can be compared
      only with citrus. Vitis Vinifera (this is exactly the kind of Vitis from which we get the best wines in the world) no
      has resistance to fungal diseases, which means that if there is rain and high humidity, the grapes in
      99% of cases will be sprayed. And here we ask ourselves: what is natural wine?

      First, let's start with the fact that all wine is natural by nature - it is made from grapes. However, in the process
      cultivation of grapes and works on its transformation into wine (according to the European canons, wine is a product of fermentation
      grapes (must), all other alcoholic beverages derived from other fruits and berries, wine can not be called),
      depending on the goals, objectives and philosophy of the manufacturer, can use a variety of techniques. Industries
      winemaking, organic, biodynamics, natural wine. Let's take a closer look at the last three practices that exist
      the most "natural" in nature.

      Organics.
       Organic movement has been actively gaining popularity since the end of the XX century and is seen as an attempt to rethink attitudes.
       man to the environment. The focus of organics is the earth. All organic producers focus on transformation and
       maintaining a healthy soil life cycle. Ecological diversity, natural animal population on
       vineyard, natural soil fertility - one of the few postulates of this trend.

      The aim is also to minimize environmental damage by avoiding the use of mineral salt fertilizers and agrochemicals.
      pesticides, as well as minimizing the use of non-renewable resources. All synthetic pesticides are prohibited except
      use of "Bordeaux mixture" - a drug based on lime and copper sulfate, one of the few admitted to
      use in both organic and biodynamic - because for a long time it was literally a panacea for dangerous
      fungal disease in the vineyard - mildew (powdery mildew).

      Emphasis on the immunity of the earth itself. In general, everything is logical and beautiful, but expensive. Organic producers must pass
      certification (and hundreds of certification bodies have been set up for this) and pay contributions. And in Europe it is technical
      definition of organic wine - wine made from organically grown grapes. Which suggests what to work with
      grapes on wineries is not regulated (and accordingly, the use of various wine preparations is allowed).

      Here everything is complicated and ... metaphorically. Let's start with the fact that most scientists do not even want to hear about biodynamics. It
      the theory first described by the Austrian philosopher, founder of "anthroposophy" Rudolf Steiner in 1924 - and this is the theory
      about agriculture in general. In essence, these are stricter organic practices in the vineyard and minimal intervention
      in winemaking processes, but with a number of very significant differences. Biodynamic practices involve use
      a number of drugs, and if some of them seem completely harmless - such as passing pus
      "Transformation" in cow horns buried in a vineyard during the winter, or the use of chamomile to reduce
      level of stress on the vine after the hail, some practices of many seem downright strange and even occult. What you
      Tell me about the fermentation of yarrow in the bladder of deer (drug 502 in biodynamics)? There in the treasury
      unexplained (scientific) things - biodynamic calendar contains astrological elements, and standard practice
      "Dynamization" of drugs by mixing them in a certain way seems a bit pointless. Also evil tongues
      It is rumored that Steiner received a theoretical explanation for these practices ... while he was in a trance.

      What can we oppose? The best (and most expensive) wines in the world are biodynamics, and often only wines are made
      best after the transition to this practice.

      When you get acquainted with the theory closer, you start visiting farms, walking the land - with live grass and insects on
      to listen to the stories of winemakers - you need to be very stubborn, at least not to treat biodynamics
      seriously. Domaine Romanee-Conti, which is the most expensive wine in the world, switched to organic methods for several decades
      therefore, and since 2008 all their vineyards are only biodynamics. The goal of biodynamics is healthy living soil in balance
      with healthy vines, which are also in harmony with nature and can protect themselves from pests and
      diseases. Since the earth and plants are sensitive to "cosmic forces", all manipulations (planting vines, plowing, harvesting
      harvest) should be regulated by the cycle of planets in the zodiac - especially the Sun and Moon.

      Biodynamics was banned in Germany during the Third Reich (1933-1945), so to denote drugs
      used code numbers - from 500 onwards. The practice has taken root and is still used - 500 (cow
      manure) and the 501st drugs (quartz) are used almost everywhere because they promote a healthy life cycle
      soil and vines, other drugs - as intended.

      Biodynamics, as well as organics, is certified. Usually on the label will be marked Demeter (certification in
      worldwide) or Biodyvin (160 growers - France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain).
      Regardless of how you feel about the above practices, these are some of the most versatile and complex wines on
      planet.

      The most embarrassing and at the same time the most difficult topic. Confused - because there are many fine wines, and complex - there is no clear
      definition of "natural wine". This term has become especially popular in the last decade, along with the growth
      popularity for environmentally friendly products and a healthy lifestyle. Almost all producers of "natural wine"
      agree that this is a wine to which "nothing has been added or taken away." One of the most ardent followers
      of natural wines, Isabelle Lageron MW, compares industrially produced wine with “a liquid analogue of broiler
      chickens ". This may be a bit exaggerated, but there is no smoke without fire. In industrial winemaking really
      use a large number of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and fermentation (the process by which yeast
      absorb sugar and alcohol is formed) takes place using a large number of "auxiliary" oenological
      drugs. In natural winemaking all this is not or at least should not be, but who will control
      natural producer somewhere high in the mountains? It remains to hope for the conscience of the winemaker.

      Natural wines usually have much less sulfur dioxide - although it should be noted that many of
      Conscious winemakers from the practices described above add very little sulfur just before bottling for
      maintaining the stability of wine. This is usually 30-45 mg / l, compared to the sulfur content in dried apricots and other dried fruits, which
      we buy on the market, it's a trifle. By the way, sulfur intolerance is observed in only 1% of the population, that is
      very rare phenomenon. And yes, all wines will contain sulfur to one degree or another - it is a by-product of alcohol
      fermentation. If you have a headache in the morning, do not think that sulfur is to blame. Perhaps the question is simple
      in the amount of wine drunk, and a very good prevention of a hangover is a large amount of water drunk. Experienced
      winemakers teach like this: a glass of wine is a glass of water. At least.

      The most popular representatives of "natural wines" - pet-naty, these are sparkling wines made by the method of "unestral", so
      the so-called "grandfather's method", and "orange", they are "amber" wines - a technology under which white wine
      exposed to prolonged contact with the skin, by analogy with the production of red wines. However, not all amber wines
      natural, not all natural wines are good, and there are a large number of producers without certification who at the same time make
      wonderful wines. How to find and learn them?

      Very easy. Try it.
